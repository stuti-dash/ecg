# ECG Signal Processing and Classification
ECG Signal Processing and Classification
Overview
This project focuses on processing and classifying ECG signals using digital filtering and machine learning techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful features from raw ECG data, remove noise, and classify different heart conditions.

Technologies Used
MATLAB/Python: For digital filtering and signal processing.
SPICE: Simulated RC Low-Pass Filter to remove high-frequency noise.
Machine Learning: Implemented ML models for ECG classification.
Dataset: Processed ECG signals from available datasets for model training and testing.

Features Implemented
